This is an Android app for Udacity's Android Basic lesson.

It's been a great journey for me to learn Android Basics since this course started back in January of 2018. And here's my so-called final project. First of all, I do have some web programming background therefore I really want to push myself to the limit and apply all of the Android/JAVA skills I learned from the course plus a little two cents of my own. I also do online search for the techniques that I never knew of and really want to achieve it.

### Things that I learned from online research
- How to do Intent Activity;
- How to programmatically create object: radio button and checkbox;
- How to disable keyboard when activity starts;
- How to prevent user click "back" button;

### Project planning and critical thinking
- A.) I want to programmatically create my checkbox and radio buttons so I can use my object to identify which question goes with which type of display method.;
- B.) I want to create a big “Questionary” class that defines all of my:
	#### a.Question library
	#### b.Answer library
	#### c.Correct Answer library
	#### d.Images library
	#### e.Type of Answer (Radio or Checkbox)
	#### f.Total numbers of my questions
	#### g.Validation of my correct answer
	#### h.Validation of Radio or Checkbox method for each question;
- C.) A score board after finish the quiz. Percentage and the ability to replay the quiz.;

Any suggestion or comments are welcome and I really appreciate any helpful tips.
